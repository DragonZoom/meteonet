#+TITLE: Meteonet dataset and associated dataloader

* Objectives
  Write the most efficient dataloader for meteonet, both for
  classification, and regression.
  Then, adapt it to Vincent's code, then all my students codes.

  Compared to data prepared by Vincent, there is no PPMatrix nor
  train/val subdirectories.

* Structure of this repository (currently under developpement )

:  download-meteonet.sh   # script that's downloading meteonet dataset (11 Gb)
:  meteonet/              # meteonet dataset, downloaded by previous script
:  download-meteonet-reduced.sh  # download a small meteonet dataset (1.8 Gb)
:  data/                  # small meteonet dataset, downloaded by previous script
:  loader/                # torch dataloader functions
:     utilities.py        # utilities functions to filter and sorted meteonet files
:     loader.py           # contains MeteoetDataset class
:     samplers.py         # oversampling routines
: model/                  # U-net to test training
: train.py                # traning routine for unet

* Setup
 
  - requirements: pytorch, matplotlib, numpy, tqdm
  - Usage:
    1. download one of the two database
    2. run train.py
