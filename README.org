#+TITLE: Meteonet dataset and associated dataloader

* Goal:
  Write the most efficient dataloader for meteonet, both for
  classification, and regression.
  Then, adapt it to Vincent's code, then all my students codes.

  Compared to data prepared by Vincent, there is no PPMatrix nor
  train/val subdirectories.

* Structure of this repository (currently under developpement )

:  data.sh              script that's downloading meteonet dataset
:  data/                meteonet data, to be loaded using data.sh script
:  loader/              torch dataloader functions
:     utilities.py      utilities functions to filter and sorted meteonet files
:     loader.py         contains MeteoetDataset class
:     sampler.py        oversampling routine

* Usage (to do)
  1. Data preparation.
     Edit parameters (periods for train and validation sets, rain
     thresholds) from initdatasets.py and run the script.
     It will write a data/config.npz file which will read by the others
     scripts.
     
  2. 

* Roadmap
  1. le dossier data
  - transform initdatasets.py as a function in utilities module
  - finalize these scripts, the ultimate test is to sucessfully train the U-net
  - transfer data/ on my webpage as a tarball gzipped file
