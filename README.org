#+TITLE: Meteonet dataset and associated dataloader

* Objectives
  Write the most efficient dataloader for meteonet, both for
  classification, and regression.
  Then, adapt it to Vincent's code, then all my students codes.

  Compared to data prepared by Vincent, there is no PPMatrix nor
  train/val subdirectories.

* Structure of this repository 

:  download-meteonet.sh   # script that downloads meteonet dataset (11 Gb)
:  download-meteonet-reduced.sh  # download a small meteonet dataset (1.8 Gb)
:  data/                  # meteonet dataset, downloaded by previous scripts
:  loader/                # torch dataloader functions
:     utilities.py        # various functions
:     meteonet.py         # the MeteonetDataset class
:     samplers.py         # oversampling routines
      filesets.py         # split meteonet files in train/val/test
      plots.py            # plot functions
:  models/                # Currently only U-net to test training
:  trainers/              # Currenlty, only classification
:  train-Unet.py          # training routine for unet
:  eval-Unet.py           # evaluation procedure
:  test*.py               # various tests
* Setup
 
  - requirements: pytorch, matplotlib, numpy, tqdm, tensorboard, pandas
  - Usage:
    1. download one of the two databases
    2. run =train-Unet.py=
       : % python train-Unet -h   # for usage
       : % python train-Unet      # start a training only on rainmaps with a correct hyperparameters setup
       : % python eval-Unet      # evaluation of last run on the test sets
       : % python train-Unet -wd data/windmaps   # start a training on rainmaps and windmaps
       : % python eval-Unet
